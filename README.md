Customer segmentation is a typical strategy used by organizations to categories clients based on their demographics, shopping patterns, or other traits.
Customer segmentation constitutes a widely adopted strategic approach within organizations, aimed at systematically categorizing clients by analyzing a spectrum of factors such as demographics, shopping patterns, and other discernible traits. By effectively segmenting the customer base, businesses gain the ability to tailor their offerings, communications, and marketing efforts with a higher degree of precision, ultimately leading to enhanced customer satisfaction, targeted engagement, and improved overall business performance.
